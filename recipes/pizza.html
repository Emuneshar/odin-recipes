        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Pizza is a popular and beloved Italian dish that has become famous worldwide. It typically consists of a round, flat dough base, which is traditionally made from wheat flour, water, yeast, salt, and olive oil. The dough is stretched or rolled out into a thin circle and baked in an oven. The result is a crispy, golden crust that serves as the foundation for various toppings.</p>
