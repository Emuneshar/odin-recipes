        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare the Meat Sauce</li>
            <ol>
                <li>In a large skillet, cook the ground beef or Italian sausage over medium heat until browned. Break it up into small pieces as it cooks.</li>
                <li>Add the chopped onion and minced garlic to the meat and cook until the onion is softened.</li>
                <li>Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, diced tomatoes, dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and pepper.</li>
                <li>Simmer the sauce for about 20-30 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove from heat and set it aside.</li>
            </ol>
            <li>Prepare the Bechamel Sause</li>
            <ol>
                <li>In a separate saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat</li>
                <li>Stir in the flour and cook for a couple of minutes until it becomes a pale, golden color</li>
                <li>Gradually whisk in the milk, and continue to cook, whisking constantly, until the sauce thickens</li>
                <li>Season the bechamel sauce with nutmeg (if desired), salt, and pepper. Remove it from the heat</li>
            </ol>
            <li>Assemble the Lasagna</li>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C)</li>
                <li>Spread a small amount of the meat sauce on the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish to prevent the noodles from sticking</li>
                <li>Place 3 lasagna noodles on top of the sauce</li>
                <li>Layer the following in this order: meat sauce, bechamel sauce, mozzarella cheese, and a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese</li>
                <li>Repeat the layers until you've used all the noodles, finishing with a layer of meat sauce on top</li>
                <li>Drop spoonfuls of ricotta cheese evenly over the top layer of meat sauce</li>
            </ol>
            <li>Bake</li>
            <ol>
                <li>Cover the baking dish with foil and bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes</li>
                <li>Remove the foil and bake for an additional 15-20 minutes or until the top is bubbly and golden</li>
            </ol>
            <li>Rest and Serve</li>
            <ol>
                <li>Let the lasagna rest for about 10-15 minutes before cutting into it. This helps it hold its shape</li>
                <li>Sprinkle with fresh basil or parsley (if desired) before serving</li>
            </ol>
            <li>Enjoy</li>
            <ol>
                <li>Serve your homemade lasagna hot, and enjoy this classic Italian comfort food</li>
